The watch writes a WigleWifi-1.6 CSV between two marker lines when it is sent
WIGLE on its console (see wigleExport in src/main.cpp); this keeps what is
between them. The result uploads to https://wigle.net/uploads as it is.

The port is opened without touching DTR/RTS: on the S3's native USB, the
default open is a reset, and a reset would lose nothing on flash but would
drop the GPS fix mid-drive. The port's USB serial number is the watch's MAC,
so the board is checked before anything is opened.
