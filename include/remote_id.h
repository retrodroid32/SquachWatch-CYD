// SquachWatch-CYD — ASTM F3411 "Remote ID" decoder
//
// The DRONE detection has always been a presence flag: service UUID 0xFFFA
// is in the advert, so something compliant is overhead. The advert also
// contains a 25-byte message saying WHICH aircraft, where it is, and -- in
// the System message -- where its OPERATOR is standing. That last one is
// the reason this file exists. Everything else on this device tells you a
// thing is nearby; this tells you where the person holding it is.
//
// Scope, honestly: this decodes the Bluetooth LEGACY form, which is AD type
// 0x16 service data under UUID 0xFFFA carrying one message per
// advertisement, and the WiFi Beacon form, a vendor element packing several
// messages together (mergeBeacon). It does not decode Bluetooth 5 Long
// Range, and it cannot: the ESP32-WROOM in this board is BLE 4.2 and
// Espressif document that it has no hardware support for Coded PHY or
// extended advertising, which is where the second half of the drones are.
// Nor the WiFi NAN form, which rides action frames, not beacons.
//
// Source for every offset and constant below: opendroneid-core-c, the
// reference implementation of the standard.
