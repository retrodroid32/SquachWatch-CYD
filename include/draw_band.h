// SquachWatch-CYD — which rows are actually being drawn right now.
//
// The 3.5" is the only board that cannot hold a whole frame in RAM. It draws
// its 480x320 screen as two 480x160 bands: one half-height sprite, filled and
// pushed at the top of the panel, then filled again and pushed halfway down.
// Both passes run the entire screen's drawing code. The sprite's viewport
// throws away whatever lands outside the band, so the picture is right -- but
// it is thrown away one primitive at a time, after the work of asking for it.
// Measured on the board, the second pass costs exactly what the first does:
// 10.1 / 8.6 ms on FIREFLIES, 22.8 / 21.8 on the aquarium. Half the drawing
// on that board is for rows the pass cannot reach.
//
// This is the row range the current pass can reach, in panel coordinates, so
// that a block of drawing can decline in one call instead of being clipped a
// pixel at a time. It is a HINT ABOUT PIXELS ONLY: skipping a block must
// never skip the state behind it, or the two passes disagree about the world
// and the screen tears between them. Positions, physics, hit rectangles and
// anything else read after the frame are computed either way -- only the
// painting is skipped.
//
// On every other board there is one pass over a full-height sprite, so the
// band is the whole screen and no block would ever be skipped. Rather than
// leave a live comparison in those builds' hot loops, has() compiles to
// `true` there and the guards vanish -- verified by building cyd-fast before
// and after and byte-comparing the firmware.
